    <title>FileBridge | Privacy Policy</title>
  </Fragment>
  <p>This is the privacy policy for the FileBridge iOS/iPad OS application.</p>
  <h2>In short</h2>
  <p>FileBridge and the developer (kingbri) do not collect your data. Period.</p>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>
    FileBridge is an app meant to run locally on your iDevice. The only contents pulled from
    the internet are tutorial videos used in the “Guides” section of the app.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>
    Due to the app being free and open source (FOSS), you can view
    <a href="https://github.com/kingbri1/FileBridge">the code</a>
    and see that the app physically cannot collect your data.
  </p>
  <h2>Does this comply with COPPA?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, FileBridge does comply with the Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act.
    Personal information is not collected from anyone which includes individuals under the age
