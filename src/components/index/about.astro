      My name is Brian, known online as kingbri. I&apos;m a student doctor pursuing a DO degree with
      a planned specialization in immunology.

      My primary interests have always been in medicine and learning how the human body works. As such,
      I have spent many years over studying biology, anatomy, nutrition, and other fields of medicine.
      Having faced chronic illness myself, I am dedicated to ensuring others can lead happy and healthy
      lives.

      However, this website focuses more on my software development expertise. I first learned how to
      program in Python at age 15 and created a small mario-kart 2d-game in processing.py. However, I
      lost interest in programming due to a lack of project ideas.

      Eventually, I stumbled upon the Android community and built my own custom kernel in 2018 using
      C. In February of 2020, I started programming bots using the Discord, Twitch, and Twitter APIs.
      These bots are semi-popular, and I have designed them with goals of educating the public and making
      my social media life easier. The same principle applies to Apple applications that I created in
      to make various functions easier on end-user iDevices.
      <br />
      <br />
      Currently, I am exploring the field of AI, including subfields such as Stable Diffusion and the
      use of LLMs for creative writing. My interest and skills in software development complement my
      future medical career, as learning multiple languages and principles will help me succeed and potentially
      develop healthcare-oriented software.
